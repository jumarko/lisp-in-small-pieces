# lisp-in-small-pieces
For the examples from the book Lisp in Small Pieces. 

See also [Chouser's book club](https://chouser.us/lisp2022/) and [his code](https://github.com/Chouser/lisp-in-small-pieces-clj) (actually, you're very likely better off studying that instead of my own code since it's gonna be shorter and cleaner :) ).
