	* LiSP-2ndEdition.tgz : Shortened lines in some files to cope with
	the new French edition that is printed on a slightly less larger
	paper.

	* fixed some years ago a bug in cps-begin visible in the first 
	Edition (French or English): the order of evaluation was wrong.
	Thanks to Luc Moreau do have discovered it.

        * Book.mkf : Written customization for Gambit and Elk so you can
        run the programs of the book with them. Still a problem with
        syntax-case with Gambit and don't use -l in Elk since you loose
        top-level-environment at that time (so you have to load
        "elk/book.elk" by hand).
        
        * Many files: Changed slightly many files for names, presentation,
        comments etc to ease the English translation.

Thu Oct  6 11:00:50 1994  Christian Queinnec  <queinnec@blaye.inria.fr>

        * src/chap4a.scm : globalized the local `shared' variable so it
        can be reset to () in file-test. This fix allows to remove lots of
        annoying quotations that appeared in scheme.tst.

Fri Sep  2 14:53:49 1994  Christian Queinnec  (queinnec@blaye.inria.fr)

        * src/chap9e.scm ((->Scheme (e Function) r)): contains a call to
        gensym with an argument: removed that argument.
        Also corrected src/chap9c.tst which contains a bugged test.

Wed Aug 31 11:12:17 1994  Christian Queinnec  (queinnec@blaye.inria.fr)

        * src/chap6f.scm ((generate-user-global-variables out)): global
        variables are printed in uppercase since rt.h supposed it and scm
        prints it in lowercase by default.

        * src/chap8k.scm (reflisp): the macroexpansion (monitor and
        the-environment are the only macros) is now done by hand.

        * src/chap7g.scm ((test-scheme7g file)): To protect the si
        directory that is used to regenerate the book with hand-improved
        programs, change si/ into tmp.si/ for tests. Also change Test.mkf.

Tue Aug 30 19:50:56 1994  Christian Queinnec  (queinnec@blaye.inria.fr)

        * src/chap6f.scm ((get-reference value)): It does not seem
        mandatory in Scheme that symbol->string gives eq results for a
        singe symbol !? So changed eq? to equal? in that function.

        * Test.mkf (GRAND_TEST_FLAGS): Added this entry to check all tests
        as well as a perl script to inspect the results.

        * src/chap6e.scm ((PREDEFINED i)): added that instruction which
        was missing.

Mon Aug 29 11:22:12 1994  Christian Queinnec  (queinnec@blaye.inria.fr)

        * src/chap10m.scm: Made a file of letify (changed also its name
        from letify! to letify since there are no longer side-effects) to
        ease testing it. Removed the patch from src/chap10c.scm (the
        method on lift-procedure!).

Sun Aug 28 11:12:06 1994  Christian Queinnec  (queinnec@blaye.inria.fr)

        * src/chap10c.scm ((lift-procedures! (o Free-Reference) flatfun
        vars)): Added that due to a bug wrt CPS. Bug triggered by the `if'
        form in (lambda (l c)
                  (if c l #t)
                  (lambda (max min) l c ) )
        which duplicates the continuation and lift! walks two times this
        continuation.

        * src/chap10k.scm ((test-scheme10k file)): changed equal to
        naive-match since test suite chap10k.tst needs it.

        * bigloo/compapp.scm (compile-bigloo-application): force the order
        of expansion in case of multiple files. Added *verbose* flag.

        * src/chap10h.scm: commented definitions of generate-declarations
        and generate-prototypes which were obsolete (still using
        Functional-Description-Cname).

        * src/chap10f.scm ((compiler-entry-point options)): Added this
        function to serve as an entry point for a standalone compiler from
        Scheme to C.

Sat Aug 27 09:36:08 1994  Christian Queinnec  (queinnec@blaye.inria.fr)

        * src/chap10e.scm (g.current): added missing variables.

        * src/chap10a.scm (objectify-error): added missing variables
        definition.
        ((objectify-sequence e* r)): Fixed a problem of evaluation order.

        * src/chap9c.scm (objectify-error): added missing variables definition.
        ((objectify-sequence e* r)): Fixed a problem of evaluation order.

        * bigloo/rtbook+.bgl ((bounded-display o stream)): Defined that
        function to limit display for circular objects.

        * src/chap8c.scm (original.g.current): added wrek as a new
        variable to the mutable global environment. Don't forget to
        register it for testing with original.g.current).

        * src/chap8b.tst: Last part of src/chap8a.tst dealing with eval on
        dynamic variables.

        * src/chap8b.scm (wrek): added display and some additional locations

        * src/chap8a.scm ((program? e)): Fixed a bug on all-programs?
        Added definitions for global-value and set-global-value!.

        * src/chap7f.scm ((ALLOCATE-DOTTED-FRAME arity)): an error of 1.

        * src/chap7d.scm (*exit*): Missing definitions for registers and
        other global variables. an old defmacro changed into a
        define-abbrevation. 
        (decode-clause): To use hygienic macros made the reference to 
        fetch-byte to be global instead of being the local function of
        instrunction-decode.

        * bigloo/rtbook.bgl (show): Added the definition of the generic
        function show to make Meroonet more alike Meroon where that
        function is predefined.

        * src/chap7c.scm (install-regular-combinators): similar to
        src/chap6d.scm. Missing definitions for registers and other global
        variables.

        * src/chap7b.scm (install-regular-combinators): similar to
        src/chap6d.scm. Missing definitions for registers and other global
        variables. Fixed the definition of list.

        * src/chap7a.scm (list): Fixed the definition of list.

Fri Aug 26 19:05:41 1994  Christian Queinnec  (queinnec@blaye.inria.fr)

        * src/chap7a.scm (install-regular-combinators): similar to
        src/chap6d.scm

        * src/chap6f.scm (gensym6f): Bigloo's gensyms are not legal
        identifiers for C so changed gensym for gensym6f.

        * src/chap6a.scm (static-wrong): Moved this variable to rtbook+.bgl

        * Test.mkf (rtbook+): Split the runtime library of the book
        interpreter for bigloo in two parts; this was due to the lack of pp, 
        format and other things (taken from the Scheme Repository).

        * bigloo/compapp.scm: Introduced that file to automatize
        compilation of stand alone applications for Bigloo. This supposes
        the existence of a runtime library rtbook.a

        * src/chap6d.scm (install-regular-combinators): Substituted
        set-top-leve-value (a scheme2c dependency for eval).

Thu Aug 25 14:44:30 1994  Christian Queinnec  (queinnec@blaye.inria.fr)

        * src/chap5h.scm ((determine! . thunks)): Finished that file. Paid
        attention to multiple return of a same continuation.

        * src/chap5e.scm ((possible-paths m+)): a badly migrated lambda to
        improve typography was corrected.

        * src/chap5d.scm (display): Display was present in chap5-bench
        and missing here.

        * src/chap5b.scm (r.init): Removed bugged quasi-normal order patches.

        * src/chap5a.scm (display): Display was present in chap5-bench
        and missing here.

        * chap4a.scm (create-string): Added the string type.

Tue Aug 23 11:03:31 1994  Christian Queinnec  (queinnec@blaye.inria.fr)

        * Made first distribution of all the programs that accompany my
        book.  It is named LiSP<date>.tar.gz. Ported to scm, bigloo and
        scheme->c.
